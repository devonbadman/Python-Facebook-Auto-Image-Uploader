simple python script to grab a picture from your webcam every time the hours, minutes and seconds are equal and post them to facebook.

To use, download and run main.pyc

src is available, but you will need to use your own app key if you wish to edit it, however, feel free to fork the code then apply to get your changes aplied back in to the master branch.

ALL CODE copied or modified in anyway must be supplied with a link back to here, I would do the same for you.
